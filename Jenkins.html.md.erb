# Deprecation Notice

Since release 15.11.02.01, CloudBees Jenkins Operations Center is now provided
as part of the tile CloudBees Jenkins Platform (https://network.pivotal.io/products/cloudbees),
so the installation of this tile is no longer necessary.

# Migration to the CloudBees Jenkins Platform tile

If you need to migrate your existing CloudBees Jenkins Operations Center tile content over to the new tile,
please apply the following steps.

## Export current CJOC configuration

* Log in to a host with access to the Bosh Director.
* Make sure the current bosh deployment targets the CJOC tile. Otherwise, look for the most recent manifest under `/var/tempest/workspaces/default/deployments` and `bosh deployment /var/tempest/workspaces/default/deployments/p-jenkins-oc-xxxx.xml`
* Use `bosh ssh` to connect to the vm running jenkins-oc (should be jenkins-oc-xxx/0). We will refer to this job name as JOB_INDEX in next steps.
* `sudo su` to switch to root user.
* `cd /var/vcap/store`
* `zip -y -r -0 /tmp/jenkins-oc.zip jenkins-oc/`
* `exit`
* `bosh scp $JOB_INDEX --download /tmp/jenkins-oc.zip .`
* A file named `jenkins-oc.zip.jenkins-oc.0` (or similar, depending on the job name) will be created in the current directory. For convenience, we'll rename it back to `jenkins-oc.zip`.

## Remove the CJOC tile and install the CJP tile

If you don't remove the CJOC tile, it will try to register the same url as the CJOC instance in the CJP tile, which will cause you problems.

## Import Configuration in the CloudBees Jenkins Platform tile

* Log in to a host with access to the Bosh Director.
* Make sure the current bosh deployment targets the CJP tile. Otherwise, look for the most recent manifest under `/var/tempest/workspaces/default/deployments` and `bosh deployment /var/tempest/workspaces/default/deployments/p-jenkins-xxxx.xml`
* `bosh vms` and look for the job index containing `jenkins-oc-` (like jenkins-oc-xxx/0) pattern. This will be referred as JOB_INDEX in next steps.
* `bosh scp $JOB_INDEX --upload jenkins-oc.zip /tmp`
* `bosh ssh` and select the job named $JOB_INDEX
* `sudo su` to switch to root user
* `monit stop jenkins-oc` to stop CJOC service
* `cd /var/vcap/store`
* `mv jenkins-oc jenkins-oc.backup`
* `unzip -X /tmp/jenkins-oc.zip -d .`
* `monit start jenkins-oc` to start CJOC service.
* Check CJOC by browsing http://jenkins-oc-0.yourcfdomain.com. Your data should be there.

* Once you have verified that your data is here, you can remove `/var/vcap/store/jenkins-oc.backup` and `/tmp/jenkins-oc.zip`.

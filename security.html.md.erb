title: Security: CloudBees Jenkins Operations Center integration with Pivotal Cloud Foundry
---

### Introduction
This is a guide on how to use CloudBees Jenkins Operations Center security model integrates with Pivotal Cloud Foundry on your Cloud Foundry installation.

This guide will cover:

1. Authentication: Pivotal Cloud Foundry / UAA as the Identity Provider (IDP) f the SSO Authentication for Jenkins
2. Authorization: Cloud Foundry Authorization model based on organizations and spaces in Jenkins
3. Administrator permissions on Jenkins
4. Resetting the permissions

### Authentication: Pivotal Cloud Foundry / UAA as the Identity Provider (IDP) of the SSO Authentication for Jenkins

The UAA is the identity management service for Cloud Foundry and acts a SSO service for Jenkins. This means that all the users can authenticate to Jenkins using the same credentials used to access the CF platform.

### Authorization: Cloud Foundry Authorization model based on organizations and spaces in Jenkins

The Jenkins instance will come pre-configured with some Authorization settings that limit the read-write permission of the user to the CF organizations he belongs to. 
For each logged-in user a folder will be automatically created (if does not exist yet) for each organization the user belongs to and an additional folder specific to the user: the latter will be only visible by the specific user, wherease the organization-folders will be shared across all the members of the same organizations.

For example, an user belonging to the CF organization "cloudbees"

  ![Authorization]
  <%= image_tag("../images/authorisation-1.2.png") %>


will belong to the matching external group "cloudbees" in Jenkins

  ![Authorization]
  <%= image_tag("../images/authorisation-1.1.png") %>

and will have access to the "cloudbees" folder and to the folder specific for his user.


  ![Authorization]
  <%= image_tag("../images/authorisation-1.png") %>


Someone else belonging to the CF organization "pivotal" 

  ![Authorization]
  <%= image_tag("../images/authorisation-2.2.png") %>

will belong to the matching external group "pivotal" in Jenkins

  ![Authorization]
  <%= image_tag("../images/authorisation-2.1.png") %>

and will have access to the "pivotal" folder, plus to the folder specific for his user. 


  ![Authorization]
  <%= image_tag("../images/authorisation-2.png") %>

Note that he won't have any visibility on the "cloudbees" folder or access to other users' specific folders:  the two users belong to different organizations and the work environments will be completely isolated.

Differently, a CF administrator (whoever is member of the UAA group `cloud_controller.admin`) will have access to all the CF organizations.

  ![Authorization]
  <%= image_tag("../images/authorisation-3.2.png") %>

As conseguence, the admin user in Jenkins will be member of all the external groups matching these organizations

  ![Authorization]
  <%= image_tag("../images/authorisation-3.1.png") %>

and will be allowed to access all the existing Jenkins folders

  ![Authorization]
  <%= image_tag("../images/authorisation-3.png") %>
### Administrator permissions on Jenkins

Members of the UAA group cloud_controller.admin` are granted the admin privileges in Jenkins and will be part of the `Administrator` group

#### Troubleshooting: resetting the permissions

Disable security as recommended in https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Disable+security

For this, you need to access to the jenkins master file system `/var/vcap/store/jenkins_master`.

On restart, CloudBees Jenkins Operations Center for Pivotal Cloud Foundry, it automatically configures Pivotal Cloud Foundry Single Sign On.
To disable this automatic configuration, create the following empty files:

* `/var/vcap/store/jenkins_master/.disable-authentication-script`
* `/var/vcap/store/jenkins_master/.disable-authorization-script`
